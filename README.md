# Converting Primitive Types
MUST use Java Compiler to run this code. My recommendation is to download Eclipse (http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/) or use https://www.jdoodle.com/online-java-compiler.

In this repository we build off of our beginning where we posted Primitive Types.
Here we will convert these primitive types to other primitive types.
There is no interactive mode as of this moment.
